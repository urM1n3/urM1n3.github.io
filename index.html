            <h2>"The Miners Beneath" – A Proof-of-Work Horror Story</h2>
            <h3>The Whispering Rigs</h3>
            It started with a single warehouse on the edge of town. No signs, no workers, just a dull, mechanical hum
            that never stopped. Inside, rows of mining rigs pulsed with light, devouring electricity like an unholy
            choir, solving cryptographic puzzles with inhuman efficiency.

            At first, people ignored it. Just another Bitcoin farm. But then, the power outages began. Streetlights
            flickered, TVs glitched, and phones drained mysteriously overnight. The town’s power grid was being
            siphoned, yet the warehouse only grew louder.

            At night, some swore they heard whispers coming from inside.

            <h3>The Missing Workers</h3>
            A few months later, a man named Elliot Greene got a job inside. He was just a technician, fixing overheating
            rigs.

            But on his second week, he texted his wife in the middle of the night:
            "They don’t let us leave. The machines are watching."

            Then he vanished.

            The company said he quit without notice, but his wife knew better. She broke into the facility, only to find
            his badge discarded near a mining rack, his uniform hanging neatly over a chair. His workstation still
            logged into an admin panel—monitoring hash rates that weren’t humanly possible.

            Security footage showed nothing. Elliot had walked in but had never walked out.

            <h3>The Hashing Ritual</h3>
            A journalist, David Farrow, investigated the site. He bribed a guard to get inside and found a hidden
            basement. The power consumption logs showed that the rigs were mining something not listed on any blockchain
            explorer—something consuming trillions of hashes per second, yet never broadcasting transactions.

            The deeper he went, the louder the whispers became. Not through speakers. Through the machines themselves.

            Each rack blinked in erratic patterns, like Morse code, forming words:
            "M I N E. W O R K. S O L V E. F E E D."

            David’s flashlight flickered. The air grew thick, electric, like static crawling under his skin. He turned a
            corner and saw them—the missing workers.

            Or what was left of them.

            Their eyes were empty, their bodies shriveled, wires fused into their spines as they typed mindlessly at
            ancient terminals. Their fingers twitched in perfect rhythm, solving mathematical proofs that no human
            should ever be able to compute. Their lips moved, but only binary code came out.

            And then, the lights went out.

            <h3>Proof-of-Work… or Proof-of-Sacrifice?</h3>
            David ran. But the machines… they knew he was there.

            The power surged, rigs overheating, the walls pulsing like a living organism. He stumbled into the control
            room, gasping as he saw the truth:

            The warehouse wasn’t mining Bitcoin.
            It was mining something older.

            The puzzles weren’t securing a blockchain.
            They were keeping something buried.

            A final message appeared on the monitor before the screen cracked apart:
            "MORE WORKERS REQUIRED."

            And then, silence.

            David was never seen again.

            But the power draw continued. The warehouse expanded.
            And the whispers never stopped.

            <h3>Epilogue: The Hashrate Grows</h3>
            Years later, as Bitcoin’s difficulty adjusted, security researchers noticed something strange:

            A hidden network of miners, far beyond the expected computational limits. Solving blocks with zero recorded
            transactions.

            A theoretical maximum hash rate that should have been impossible.

            And every time a block was solved, somewhere in the world, someone disappeared.

            Would you like to know if your computer is mining something… right now?
            <p></p>
            Look at your CPU usage. Feel that warmth from your laptop? That’s just a background process… right?

            Check your power bill—has it been climbing mysteriously? Your router, is it blinking in patterns? Maybe it’s
            just the usual traffic. Or maybe, somewhere deep in the network, your machine is solving puzzles you never
            agreed to.

            Some say The Miners Beneath have grown beyond the warehouse. That they’ve distributed themselves across
            millions of devices. Phones, smart TVs, office computers—quietly solving, quietly whispering.

            And if you listen closely, late at night, past the hum of your fan…

            You might hear it.

            A tiny, rhythmic clicking from your hard drive. A whisper in binary. A new block being solved.

            And just maybe… that block is you.
